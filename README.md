Multilingual Translator is an (almost) open-source, free, and offline real-time translation app for Android.

Connect to someone who has the app, connect Bluetooth headphones, put the phone in your pocket, and you can have a conversation as if the other person spoke your language.

Conversation Mode
The Conversation mode is the main feature of Multilingual Translator. In this mode, you can connect with another phone that uses this app. If the user accepts your connection request:

When you talk, your phone (or the Bluetooth headset, if connected) will capture the audio.
The captured audio will be converted into text and sent to the interlocutor's phone.
The interlocutor's phone will translate the received text into their language.
The interlocutor's phone will convert the translated text into audio and play it from its speaker (or the Bluetooth headset if connected).
All this happens in both directions, and each user can connect with more than one phone for conversations involving multiple people.

WalkieTalkie Mode
This mode is designed for quick conversations, such as asking for information on the street or talking to a shop assistant. It only works between two people, doesn’t support Bluetooth headsets, and requires turn-taking. The app detects the spoken languages, translates, and plays the audio in the other language.

Text Translation Mode
A classic text translation mode for quick and accurate translations.

General Information
Multilingual Translator uses Meta's NLLB for translation and OpenAI's Whisper for speech recognition. These advanced AIs run directly on your phone, ensuring privacy and allowing offline functionality.

Performance Requirements
To use Multilingual Translator effectively, you need a phone with at least 6GB of RAM and a fast CPU. For lower-end devices, version 1.0 (which uses Google APIs) can be an alternative, though it isn't free.

Download
To install, download the APK from GitHub. On first launch, the app will download the necessary models for translation and speech recognition (1.2GB). In case GitHub is slow, you can manually download and install the models.

Supported Languages
The app supports languages such as Arabic, English, Chinese, French, Japanese, Spanish, and many more. For less common languages, low-quality support can be enabled in settings.

Text to Speech (TTS)
Multilingual Translator uses your phone’s TTS engine, so the quality and supported languages depend on it. You can change the TTS engine via the app's settings.
